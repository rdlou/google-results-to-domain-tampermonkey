# google-results-to-domain-tampermonkey
Some js I wrote during a lunch time to be able to extract the domains from the first page of google results.

One of my side projects involves looking for a lot of company domains, as they are a good unique identifier.
I get very board doing this, so have decided to build a little thing to help speed things up.

I've never written anything in JS before, so no doubt there will be things that make you cringe.  But I wanted to get this done quickly.

To use, open your console, and do a search on google.  The console will print a list of domains with their index (+1).

Select which number you'd like by hitting that number on your keyboard.  The domain will be added to your clipboard.
